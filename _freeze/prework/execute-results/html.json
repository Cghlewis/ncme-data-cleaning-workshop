Posit Cloud allows us all to work in the exact same environment with the same version of R, R packages, and directory of files. .\n\nPlease create a login to the Posit Cloud instance of this workshop here:\n\n**[https://posit.cloud/content/7872027](https://posit.cloud/content/7872027){target=\"_blank\"}**\n\n\n**Alternative**\n\nIf you are struggling using Posit Cloud, you can download the materials locally on your machine.\n\nNote that the presenter will **NOT** be able to help you with local computer problems during the workshop. To do this you will need the following to do the following prior to the workshop:\n\n-   Recent version of **R**\n\n-   Recent version of **RStudio**\n\n-   Recent version of packages used in this workshop:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npkgs <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"readxl\")\n\ninstall.packages(pkgs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Get the project on your machine. Fill in `destdir` with the location where you want to download the project. Delete that argument if you want it to default to your Desktop.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"usethis\")\nusethis::use_course(\n    \"https://github.com/jadeynryan/parameterized-quarto-workshop/raw/main/exercises/exercises.zip\",\n    destdir = \"___\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## R and RStudio\n\nFor this workshop it is assumed that you are comfortable navigating the RStudio environment and that you have some experience working with R syntax. \n\n- [Getting Started with R from R](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started)\n- [R and Tidyverse for working with data](R and the Tidyverse for working with data)\n- [R Software Handbook](https://bookdown.org/aschmi11/RESMHandbook/)\n\n## Tidyverse\n\nIf you're new to the {tidyverse}, here are some materials I recommend reviewing before the workshop.\n\n- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) \n- [Tidyverse Skills for Data Science](https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/)\n",
