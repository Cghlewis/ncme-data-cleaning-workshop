Dreaming of using just one template to generate both interactive HTML and static Word/PDF versions of your reports?\n\nJoin our workshop to unlock the power of parameterized reporting with Quarto and leave with your own template and examples to modify for your own projects.\n\nGet a sneak preview of what you'll learn by checking out the [slides](https://jadeyryan.com/talks/2023-09-25_posit_parameterized-quarto/) from my posit::conf(2023) talk.\n\nWe welcome everyone! However, if you're new to Quarto or functional programming with {purrr}, take a look at the [pre-work](prework.html#sec-quarto-purrr) for some background videos/tutorials.\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n1.  Understand what parameterized reporting is and when it is useful.\n\n2.  Learn how to convert a report into a parameterized template.\n\n3.  Render all variations of the report at once using [{quarto}](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/) and [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/).\n\n4.  Generate multiple format outputs from the same template file with conditional content and conditional code execution.\n\n## Is this workshop for me?\n\nIf your answer to any of the following questions is \"yes\", then this is the right workshop for you.\n\n-   Do you frequently report the same set of metrics, tables, or graphs for different groups?\n\n-   Do you want to stop combing through your source code to find and replace your [hard-coded values](https://www.bloomtech.com/article/what-is-hard-coding) each time you need to create a new variation of your report?\n\n-   Do you want to make your life easier and your reports more reproducible by parameterizing your reports?\n\nThe workshop is designed for those with some experience in R and R Markdown or Quarto. It will be assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation and visualization. Experience with the {tidyverse}, especially {purrr} and the pipe operator (`%>%` / `|>`), is a major plus, but is not required.\n\n## Prework\n\n# Further Reading\n\n\n\n## Speaker\n\n![](images/jadey.jpg){style=\"float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0; border-radius:50%\" fig-alt=\"Headshot of Jadey Ryan\" width=\"150\"} [**Jadey Ryan**](https://jadeyryan.com) is a self-taught R enthusiast working in environmental data science for the [Washington State Department of Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/AgScience).
