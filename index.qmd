# Overview

Before sharing research study data, it should be vetted to ensure that it is interpretable, analyzable, and reliable. This half-day, virtual workshop will provide a foundational understanding of how to organize data for the purpose of data sharing.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to assess a data set for 7 data quality indicators
- Be able to review a data set and apply a list of standardized data cleaning steps as needed
- Feel comfortable using R code to clean a data set
- Understand types of documentation that should be shared alongside data

## Is this workshop for me?

This workshop is for any education researcher who could benefit from guidance on how to take a messy raw dataset and organize it into a shareable data product.

This workshop assumes you have some experience working with rectangular data, as well as a basic working knowledge of the R programming language and experience working in RStudio. This course will focus on functions in the {Tidyverse} so familiarity with that package will be helpful, but is not required.
