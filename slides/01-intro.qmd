::: {.notes}
What do you notice when you look at these different datasets?

There is no real consistency in how data is structured, variables are named, o

Adhering to common standards for data quality allows our data to be consistently cleaned and organized within and across projects. There are several data quality criteria that are commonly agreed upon 
:::

## Learning Objectives

::: incremental

1.  Understand how to assess a data set for 7 data quality indicators

<br>

2.  Be able to review a data set and apply a list of standardized data cleaning steps as needed

<br>

3.  Feel comfortable using R code to clean a data set using our standardized steps

<br>

4.  Understand types of documentation that should be shared alongside data

:::

::: {.notes}
Before cleaning our data, we need to have a shared understanding for what we expect our data to look like once it is cleaned.
